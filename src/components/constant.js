    `At the end of the pilot, the family realizes the only way to fix
the time machine and get home is to find another focusing crystal,
and the only one that will do the job is locked away in the Tower
of London. That’s right: They’re gonna steal the Crown Jewels!
Along the way, they must navigate the politics of the times,
avoiding assassination attempts, mean Ladies in Waiting, brutal
Knights, and worst of all, a needy Queen. But by the season
finale, the family pulls off the heist of the century—the
Sixteenth Century—and powers the time machine to get home. They
land in a field overlooking a city. But where are they? And when?
Turns out the crown jewels aren’t all they’re cracked up to be and
the family finds themselves in the Italian Renaissance. It’s 17th
Century Florence but for some reason, no one is speaking Italian.
And there, flying above the anachronistic smog-filled industrial
factories is the Union Jack. Seems that giving Henry VIII the
means to take over the world worked: Europe is now part of the
United Kingdom and its Italian colony, famous to us for its art
and culture, looks like soot-covered Victorian England.`,

    `Trying to delay Lucas’s marriage to Mary for as long as possible, Evan convinces Henry that Lucas first needs to prove his worth 
      by going on a heroic quest, and to do that, he needs to train as a knight. The King agrees and assigns Lucas the job of Squire to a 
      mean son-of-a-bitch, Sir Neville. Unfortunately, Henry also puts Isabella to work as a Lady in Waiting to Princess Elizabeth which 
      Izzy finds abhorrent, spending all day with shallow girls just like back home in high school. 
      Meanwhile, Evan and Adriana go on a hunt with the King, Queen Catherine, and several courtiers, including the Archbishop of 
      Canterbury and the Duke of Norfolk. `,
    `
      Evan shows off the prototype of his new flintlock rifle but narrowly misses being killed by 
an errant shot by Norfolk. Adriana hangs back with Catherine, a needy sycophant who fawns all over Adriana in a treacly girl 
crush. She wants to be Adriana’s BFF and Adriana conspires to figure out how to use this to her advantage, if she can put up with 
Catherine long enough. 
Lucas takes a beating, figuratively and literally, learning to ride and fight, Izzy tries to fit in with the popular girls, and Evan 
survives another assassination attempt at a Banquet. It seems Norfolk really wants Evan dead, but the unsophisticated 
poisoning attempt backfires when Evan implicates Norfolk by introducing Henry to the concept of fingerprinting.
      `,

    `
      
      Norfolk is 
carted away to the Tower of London, where we see Lucas serving his brutal master Sir Neville who has Lucas, as part of his new 
duties, help him lock up the treasure room where they keep the crown jewels! Seems Adriana and Evan placed Lucas with this 
particular knight for a reason!

    `
      Lucas returns with a pic of the Black Prince Ruby, a massive jewel they need to steal to make the time machine work. Izzy lets 
loose her inner mean girl to become popular among Elizabeth’s Ladies in Waiting. And when Adriana decides to meet with the 
city prostitutes to educate them about STDs and birth control, she makes an unsettling discovery: Lucas, a brothel regular. So 
Evan has to stop and have “the talk” with Lucas before getting back to organizing the first assembly line to mass produce the new guns. Unfortunately, his industrialization efforts require he teach some basic scientific principles and this unsettles the 
Archbishop of Canterbury who summons Evan to an Inquisition. Just when Evan thought he was finally making some real 
progress, he finds himself locked in the Tower, found guilty of heresy.
      `,
  ],
  [
    `
      Evan escapes the Tower by promising Henry an even bigger and better arsenal: ironside ships to rule the seas. And with that, 
Evan starts the Industrial Revolution three hundred years early. Meanwhile, Lucas gets caught in a love triangle juggling the 
middle-aged Mary who wants a sneak preview of her wedding night and the teenage Elizabeth, in the next room, waiting for 
Lucas to recite the Shakespeare sonnets he claims he wrote for her. Adriana finds a First Lady-type pet project for Catherine 
while secretly studying the security details for the crown jewels. And Izzy uses reality show tricks to manipulate the Ladies in 
Waiting (“This is a competition—I’m not here to make friends.”) only to learn that her prize for winning this popularity contest 
is a new marriage contract… to a seventy-year-old earl with gout!
      `,

  [
    `
    Isabella bemoans her fate but gets a new lease on life when she meets Simon, a dashing boy her age who comes to court. Lucas is 
getting into trouble when he bilks the townsfolk with a new game of chance called “the lottery,” and winds up in a duel to the 
death. Here we also meet Edward, the rarely seen sickly son of Henry. Evan is tasked with tutoring him in the ways of science, 
only to discover that Edward is an informant for the Archbishop of Canterbury. Izzy is falling in love with young Simon, and 
makes a plan to be with him when her decrepit future husband arrives to claim her.
    `,

  [
    `
    There’s only so many times you can weasel your way out of a wedding and for Izzy, her luck has run out. She marries the old earl 
and goes off to York in tears. The threats against Evan are becoming too dire, and he decides it’s time to take down the 
Archbishop once and for all. He sends Lucas in wearing a wire (his iPhone), bait the pedophile Archbishop can’t resist. 
Meanwhile, Izzy’s new husband mysteriously dies of carbon monoxide poisoning when the fireplace flue is “accidentally” closed 
and Izzy returns home to her family and boyfriend Simon triumphantly—as the Dowager Countess in her own right with land, 
title, and money—just in time to witness the execution of the Archbishop. What’s more, Lucas learns that his wedding to Mary is 
set for Christmas Day and the crown jewels will be on display. The die is cast.

    `
    Using every trick in the book to steal the Black Prince Ruby, Evan reveals a fake ruby he’s been crafting since episode three with 
the help of the assembly line he built to make the rifles. Adriana is Catherine’s new best friend and as such helps her dress for 
Lucas and Mary’s wedding, switching the fake one for the real stone on the Queen’s Crown.
    
    `,

    `
    And Lucas uses his influence with Sir 
Neville’s guards to look the other way while the switch is happening. It’s all coming together, except of course, Izzy, who finally 
has the life she’s always wanted: She’s rich, important, popular, and has a cute boyfriend. She doesn’t want to go home! Still, the 
heist goes off without a hitch, until the fake ruby is accidentally discovered, Evan is seized by the guards, and on the way to the 
Tower, we reveal the guards are none other than butler John and maid Joan in disguise.
    `,

    `
    
    Evan powers up the Nissan Leaf and as 
the King’s guards storm his house, he smashes through the shed and races into London to pick up Adriana (who feels bad for 
betraying Catherine but says “Nothing personal, it’s just business.”) and rescue Lucas at the altar just about to say “I do.” They 
drag Izzy away kicking and screaming and making out with Simon, and fire up the time machine just as the guards shoot—
 The family emerges in a field.
    `,

    `
    “Where are we?” “And more importantly, when?” They look down into a city below when an Italian 
    guard sees them and calls for backup. It seems there’s been a wanted poster with their faces on it circulating for more than 
    seventy years. As they’re dragged away to a new jail, they learn they’ve travelled to Florence at the end of the Renaissance. But 
    Lucas asks, “Um, if we’re in Italy, why’s everyone speaking English?” And we reveal the flag flying above the smog-filled 
    industrial city—it’s the Union Jack of the United Kingdom.

    `
      As the family settles in to the reality that Black Prince Ruby wasn’t good enough to get them home and that Italy is now an 
English colony, the family must ingratiate themselves with the new powers that be, the Medicis. What’s more, the technology 
they gave Henry to take over the world worked like a charm and after the Great World War of 1551-1555, all of Europe is now 
part of the United Kingdom. While good for globalists, the English destroyed the artistic achievements of the Italian Renaissance 
and now the family must help the Italian separatists regain their independence from King Henry IX (Henry VIII’s grandson, 
Edward’s son), bring art back to Italy, and somehow try to improve the technology of the day to help them finally get home.
      `,
  ],
  [
    `
      Step by step the family will jump closer and closer to the 21st century, and in season three they’ll spend some lovely time in 
Feudal Japan under the Shogun. Constantly trying to undo the damage they’ve done to the timeline while at the same time saving 
their own necks, they work behind the scenes to improve the living conditions of the common people while trying at the same 
time to fix the time machine and get home.*
