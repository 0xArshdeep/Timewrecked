      We are walking the grounds, and noticing glimmers of gold dust under our feet. You have to buy the land to get the gold, and with Timewrecked, 
      that is exactly what you would be doing. Nexthollywood is a decentralized movie studio, we are pioneers and one of the leaders in the web3-film space. 
      Our team is composed of both film industry natives and web 3 natives. Through community efforts and support we can build a decentralized studio that gives opportunity for 
      filmmakers, storty-tellers and artists to have their films made without a studio breathing down their back."

      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.
